# DHARMA PROJECT

## Collaboration Guidelines

- Project is **PUBLIC** (and *indexed by search engines*): do NOT use full name references or generally any other string that may be associated with the course!
- Let's try to keep things as clean and simple as possible:
  * for an introductory guide to GitHub check the [Hello World guide] (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * *master* branch should always be *compilable* (and hopefully working)
  * new features/additions should have their own branches (create a pull request when you're done and wait for *somebody else* to review it and merge it)
  * keep additions **small**, and commit frequently
  * comment each and every thing you make (code, commits, questions, and pull requests), so that others can understand your tought process, *what* you did and *why* you did it (reference books and urls as necessary)
  * markdown is used to format text and make it easier to read ([cheatsheet here] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), no need to go crazy with it though)

  
## Proposals

Don't want to complicate things so I'm not sure if adding other tools and software to the mix is a good idea.
I'll list some possibilities here anyway:
- [Slack] (https://slack.com/is) for *__organized__ communication*.
- [GitKraken] (https://www.gitkraken.com/): if we keep things small and simple, using git **directly** is not really needed (can just use the browser based workflow form the *Hello World* guide referenced before), especially in this first stage of the project where it is not runnable yet, and modifications are rather *conceptual* in nature (can't really test them out now); should we need to use git directly though, this is a good GUI for it.
  
## How to compile and run
**TODO!** (please fill this in)
